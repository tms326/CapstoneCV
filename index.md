## My Projects at BSU:
### CS Capstone Project: Betterflye

##### Betterflye is a social engagement platform that allows users to join and create initiatives, log their community impact, and share and send their appreciation to each other.

###  The Impact Dashboard:

##### The Impact Dashboard allows users to easily view their stats and gives them easy access to the rest of the site. Users have a feed of initiatives on this page, however the feed has been turned into an event here in the screenshot.

### Initiatives:

##### Initiatives are like events, they allow users to dedicate their time and resources towards a cause they find worthy. Initiatives keep track of attendance for in-person events, the people who have signed on to the initiative, and the amounts the initiative has raised.

## CT Capstone Project:

##### The CT capstone project was a mess, the professor never really gave a good direction to go in for it, the goal from him was "make servers for an imaginary business and meet my requirements that I'll never tell you until I grade you". Somehow my team and I pulled through it and set the bar a little too high, classes after have had twice the requirements. Our imaginary business was a meat packing and processing plant, which also had a side-gig of human trafficking. Mind you, this was from the professor, not us. Software like Point-of-Sale systems, ticketing, email, etc. were setup and deployed on servers in CT's datacenter.

## CT 410:

##### The CT410 project was a semester-long massive-scale network built across multiple sites. Initially the network was just one site, but during the course the network was live-migrated to another site without losing connectivity. Even later in the semester the class combined all of their networks, where I took a leadership position helping the majority of the class coordinate their networks and the set up of the public network between them.
