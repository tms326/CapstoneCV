##### Betterflye is a social engagement platform that allows users to join and create initiatives, log their community impact, and share and send their appreciation to each other.

###  The Impact Dashboard:

##### The Impact Dashboard allows users to easily view their stats and gives them easy access to the rest of the site. Users have a feed of initiatives on this page, however the feed has been turned into an event here in the screenshot.

### Initiatives:

##### Initiatives are like events, they allow users to dedicate their time and resources towards a cause they find worthy. Initiatives keep track of attendance for in-person events, the people who have signed on to the initiative, and the amounts the initiative has raised. 

## CT Capstone Project:

##### The CT capstone project was a mess, the professor never really gave a good direction to go in for it, the goal was "make servers". Somehow my and I pulled through it and set the bar a little too high, classes now have twice the requirements.
